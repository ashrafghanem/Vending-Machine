# Vending-Machine
Design of Vending Machine that must remember how much money has been inserted based on some requirements stated below.

# Description

The Vending Machine delivers two products:

1. P1: a Bottle of Juice (Price: 3 ILS)

2. P2: a Chocolate bar (Price: 2.5 ILS)

When the user selects the required item, he has to insert the price in coins. When the value of the money inserted equals
or exceeds the listed price, the machine vends the item and returns change if any, and waits for next transaction.

The machine has a single coin slot that accepts three types of coins: (0.5 shekel, 1 shekel and 2 shekels), one coin at a time.

Note:

The machine should be able to give the correct change (e.g. when you select the first item: if the total sum is 4.5 ILS,
then your machine should give back two coins (0.5 and 1 ILS)
